Solidworks assignments
Advanced Mechanical three of the same box in different sizes
put together with pin. Advanced mechanical was about different sizes
of configurations, and mates and different types of mates
when doing configurations make sure that you go in the detail thingy.
With doing this it was hard fo me to figure out how to edit the colour of 
each piece individually. The sizing of the configurations worked fine in 
the table. For some reason when I tried to change the color even after
saying for it to just change one of them it would change all. I solved this
by making sure it was just that one. Figuring out how to not over mate
the pin was hard, but eventually it worked. The parts slide out but are still
together.

Design tables were nice since you could have the same thing in different 
sizes. A problem I had with it was the way I patterened the holes. They 
didn't readjust at first. I then redid the holes to make sure they would 
change with it. That fixed the problem. They all worked and were the correct
size and had the holes. The two of these assignments fit together.
